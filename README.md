### To do

If i had more time i would add better error handling for network requests.

If i had even more time i would also add unit tests to NetworkClient and the table view data source.

Adding caching for images is also important.

The data source should be moved out from the view controller which adds reusability.

### Additional comments

Everything was written from scratch.

The UI is not good, sorry.

For the table view data source i chose to use the new diffable data source which I had never tried before but it was really simple and easy to implement.
